I am a machine learning enthusiast with a Masterâ€™s degree in Big Data from the Warsaw School of Economics, where I graduated with honors. My thesis focused on *Adversarial Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks*, exploring model vulnerabilities and strategies for improving robustness.

Currently, I specialize in deploying Credit Risk models on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as part of MLOps initiatives. My work includes setting up Python environments for Data Science projects using tools like sklearn, xgboost, pandas, pyspark, and Kedro. I also work extensively with GCP services, Jenkins, Airflow, and MLflow for model development and deployment.

I am passionate about machine learning, learning new concepts and working on personal projects.
